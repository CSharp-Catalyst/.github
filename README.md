# Welcome to Our Innovation Hub

Our organization was founded by Krish, Lee, and myself as an after-hours side project to explore new techniques and sharpen our development skills. 
We believe in challenging the status quo by experimenting with cutting-edge technologies and building solutions that push the boundaries of traditional line-of-business processes.

## Our Mission

We are committed to fostering a collaborative environment that encourages learning and experimentation. 
Our mission is to create an adaptable, VS Code-like shell host application that simplifies complex workflows while serving as a playground for innovative development practices.

## What We’re Building

- **Shell Host Application:**  
  A versatile, customizable platform designed to provide an integrated experience for line-of-business processes. Think of it as a tailored development environment that adapts to user needs.

- **Dynamic Extensions:**  
  Plug-and-play extensions that seamlessly integrate with the shell, enabling the addition of new features and functionalities in real-time.

## Technical Vision & Stack

We are building our project using the latest technologies and lean practices to maximize both learning and efficiency:

- **Programming Language:**  
  The latest version of C# with .NET 9.0 preview.

- **Front-End:**  
  Blazor – delivering a modern and interactive user interface.

- **Back-End:**  
  A robust Web API with both REST and gRPC communications for efficient and scalable service interaction.

- **Development Tools:**  
  Visual Studio or Rider – choose your preferred environment to dive into development.

- **Key Library Dependencies:**
  - **Vogen:** To address primitive obsession and enforce domain-specific types.
  - **Fluent 2 UI:** For consistent, responsive UI design across multiple front-end technologies, including Blazor and React.
  - **xUnit v3:** Along with Shouldly and NSubstitute to ensure a high standard of testing and code quality.

## How to Get Involved

### What You’ll Need:
- **Software:**  
  Latest preview of .NET 9.0 and either Visual Studio or Rider.
  
- **GitHub Account:**  
  An active GitHub account is essential for collaboration.

- **Mindset:**  
  An eagerness to learn, experiment, and share your knowledge.

If you’re excited by the challenge and interested in contributing, please send me your GitHub username, and I will add you to the project.

## Looking Ahead

We are focused on building a sustainable and forward-thinking solution that not only pushes the limits of current technology but also creates an inspiring learning environment for all contributors. We welcome your input and collaboration on this journey.
